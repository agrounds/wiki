# Themes

In iTerm 2, ANSI colors are controlled by your chosen theme, found at

**Preferences > Profiles > Colors > Color Presets**

Colors can be manually modified, or presets can be downloaded (from https://iterm2colorschemes.com/ for instance). I like "Dark Background" and "Solarized Dark" personally.
