# pipx

https://github.com/pypa/pipx

>pipx is a tool to help you install and run end-user applications written in Python. It's roughly similar to macOS'sÂ `brew`, JavaScript'sÂ [npx](https://medium.com/@maybekatz/introducing-npx-an-npm-package-runner-55f7d4bd282b), and Linux'sÂ `apt`.

### Example
```
>> pipx install pycowsay
  installed package pycowsay 2.0.3, Python 3.7.3
  These apps are now globally available
    - pycowsay
done! âœ¨ ðŸŒŸ âœ¨


>> pipx list
venvs are in /home/user/.local/pipx/venvs
apps are exposed on your $PATH at /home/user/.local/bin
   package pycowsay 2.0.3, Python 3.7.3
    - pycowsay


# Now you can run pycowsay from anywhere
>> pycowsay mooo
