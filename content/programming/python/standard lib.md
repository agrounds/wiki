# Easy webserver

Makes it super easy to share files on a local network, for instance. Navigate to the folder you want to make available, then run

```shell
python -m http.server 8000
```

Then just go to `http://hostname:80000` to see the shared folder. If you're on MacOS, you can see your hostname in System Settings > Sharing > Hostname (e.g. `My-MacBook-Pro.local`).
