title: Hello!

I'm Alex Grounds. Welcome to my wiki! It's my place to write things down that I might want to remember later.

I like to tinker with software, and without taking notes on what I've done while tinkering I run the risk of forgetting important but tedious details. I also find that there are programming languages and libraries out there that I just can't remember how to use without a guide. I like to make cheatsheets for these.

This wiki is mostly for myself, but anyone who's curious about it is welcome to take a look around. (Make sure to expand the "explorer" dropdown on the left.) If you find any of it useful, great! Happy hacking.
